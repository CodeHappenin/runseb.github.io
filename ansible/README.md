Ansible
=======

Our last exercise for this tutorial will be an introduction to [Ansible](http://ansibleworks.com). Ansible is a new configuration management systems based on ssh communications with the instances and a no-server setup. It is easy to install and get [started](http://docs.ansible.com/intro.html). Of course it can be used in conjunction with Vagrant.
