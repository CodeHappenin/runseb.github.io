Vagrant boxes
=============

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is a tool to create *lightweight, portable and reproducible development environments*. Specifically it allows you to use configuration management tools to configure a virtual machine locally (via virtualbox) and then deploy it *in the cloud* via Vagrant providers. 

In this next exercise we are going to install vagrant on our local machine and use Exoscale vagrant boxes to provision VM in the Cloud using configuration setup in Vagrant. For future reading check this [post](http://sebgoa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/veewee-vagrant-and-cloudstack.html)
